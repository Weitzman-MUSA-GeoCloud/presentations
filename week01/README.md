## SQL Practice

As you go through and learn SQL, you may want additional exercises around the concepts you're learning. There are several sites that you can use and revisit to get practice with SQL:

### Websites

* **SQL Bolt: https://sqlbolt.com/**

  > \[A\] series of interactive lessons and exercises designed to help you quickly learn SQL right in your browser.

* **PostgreSQL Exercises: https://pgexercises.com/**
  
  > PGExercises provides a series of questions and explanations built on a single, simple dataset. It's designed for use as a partner to a good book or Postgres' excellent [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html).

* **Select Star SQL: https://selectstarsql.com/**

  > This is an interactive book which aims to be the best place on the internet for learning SQL. \[...\] It helps you learn by running queries against a real-world dataset to complete projects of consequence. It is not a mere reference page — it conveys a mental model for writing SQL.

* **SQL Zoo: https://sqlzoo.net/**

  A wiki-style site that provides 

### Books

The following excellent books are available on [O'Reilly for Higher Education](http://pwp.library.upenn.edu.proxy.library.upenn.edu/loggedin/pwp/pw-oreilly.html) through the Penn libraries:

* **_Learning SQL, 3rd Edition_, by Alan Beaulieu**
  
  > There are plenty of books out there that treat you like a dummy, idiot, or some other flavor of simpleton, but these books tend to just skim the surface. At the other end of the spectrum are reference guides that detail every permutation of every statement in a language, which can be useful if you already have a good idea of what you want to do but just need the syntax. This book strives to find the middle ground, starting with some background of the SQL language, moving through the basics, and then progressing into some of the more advanced features that will allow you to really shine.

* **_SQL Cookbook, 2nd Edition_, by Anthony Molinaro**

  > This book is meant to be for any SQL user who wants to take their queries further. In terms of ability, it’s meant for someone who knows at least some SQL—you might have read Alan Beaulieu’s _Learning SQL_, for example—and ideally you’ve had to write queries on data in the wild to answer a real-life problem.
  >
  > Other than those loose parameters, this is a book for all SQL users, including data engineers, data scientists, data visualization folk, BI people, etc. Some of these users may never or rarely access databases directly, but use their data visualization, BI, or statistical tool to query and fetch data. The emphasis is on practical queries that can solve real-world problems. Where a small amount of theory appears, it’s there to directly support the practical elements.
